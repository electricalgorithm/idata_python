# iDATA for Python

This scripts helps you to find appointments for your iDATA Visa application.

Note: This repository is created in 2023, and worked perfectly to find us free slots in iData in Turkey those times.
As far as I know, the system is changed to not catch a free slot but reservation. Therefore, it is deprecated.
At least, until the next notice.
